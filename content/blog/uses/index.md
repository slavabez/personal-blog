## OS & software

* I typically dual-boot my systems with both **Windows 10** and **Manjaro Linux**, with Manjaro being my main OS for development and Windows 10 being, well, required for some apps I have to use at work.

* [IntelliJ's WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) is my IDE of choice. WebStorm has amazing support for everything you might want to do with Javascript, including support for Node, Typescript, React, as well as GraphQL.


## Hardware  

My main machine is the powerhouse that is Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Extreme (gen 2). It boasts an octa-core i7-9750H, 32GB of RAM, 1.5TB of blazing fast SSD storage, as well as a pretty powerful Nvidia 1650 Max-Q.
