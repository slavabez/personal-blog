My name is Slava Bezgachev and I'm a full stack web developer. I'm from Kazakhstan, and I lived in the UK for 10 years. I consider myself pretty good at the following tech.

## Tech
### Javascript

- **React**. I've used React to build websites and web apps since 2017. My favourite React frameworks are **Next.js and Gatsby**.
- **Node.js**. Node is my go-to back-end development. My frameworks of choice are **Express** for very simple APIs, **Apollo Server** for GraphQL and **Socket.IO** for real-time apps.
- **Testing**. I use **Jest** for testing both the client and the server code.

### DevOps

- **Docker**. I've been using Docker for years to help me with the development and hosting.
- **Github Actions**. I used to use Travis and Circle CI for my testing and CI. Github Actions can deal with all of that now: test and build the docker containers, it's amazing.

### Other

- Other programming languages. I've chosen to specialise in Javascript, but I also have experience with: **PHP, C++, Java and .NET**.
