My name is Slava Bezgachev and I'm a full stack web developer. I'm from Kazakhstan, and I lived in the UK for 10 years. I consider myself pretty good at the following:

* **Javascript**
    * **React**. I've used React to build websites and web apps since 2017. My favourite React frameworks are **Next.js and Gatsby**.
    * **Node.js**. Node is my go-to back-end development. My frameworks of choice are **Express** for very simple APIs, **Apollo Server** for GraphQL and **Socket.IO** for real-time apps.
    * **Testing**. I use **Jest** for testing both the client and the server code.
* **DevOps**
    * **Docker**. I've been using Docker for years to help me with the development and hosting. 
    * **Github Actions**. I used to use Travis and Circle CI for my testing and CI. Github Actions can deal with all of that now: test and build the docker containers, it's amazing.
* **Other**
    * Other programming languages. I've chosen to specialise in Javascript, but I also have experience with: **PHP, C++, Java and .NET**.

Oh, and here's a great quote from this Wikipedia on
[salted duck eggs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg).

> A salted duck egg is a Chinese preserved food product made by soaking duck
> eggs in brine, or packing each egg in damp, salted charcoal. In Asian
> supermarkets, these eggs are sometimes sold covered in a thick layer of salted
> charcoal paste. The eggs may also be sold with the salted paste removed,
> wrapped in plastic, and vacuum packed. From the salt curing process, the
> salted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a
> firm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color.
