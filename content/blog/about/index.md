My name is **Slava Bezgachev** and I'm a full stack web developer. I'm from Kazakhstan, and I lived in the UK for 10 years. I consider myself pretty good at both front-end and back-end development with Javascript, with the help such tools as Node, React and many others. 

You can download [my CV here](./CV_Slava_Bezgachev.pdf), check out my [GitHub page here](https://github.com/slavabez) and also there's a neat [Stack Overflow Story](https://stackoverflow.com/users/story/2237238) where you can see my education and work history timeline.

## Tech I use
### Javascript

- **React**. I've used React to build websites and web apps since 2017. My favourite React frameworks are **Next.js and Gatsby**.
- **Node.js**. Node is my go-to back-end development. My frameworks of choice are **Express** for very simple APIs, **Apollo Server** for GraphQL and **Socket.IO** for real-time apps.
- **Testing**. I use **Jest** for testing both the client and the server code.

### DevOps

- **Docker**. I've been using Docker for years to help me with the development and hosting.
- **Github Actions**. I used to use Travis and Circle CI for my testing and CI. Github Actions can deal with all of that now: test and build the docker containers, it's amazing.
- **Linux**. I've been using Linux as my primary operating system and primary hosting environment for around 5 years. I've used Ubuntu Server and Debian for hosting. 

### Other

- Other programming languages. I've chosen to specialise in Javascript, but I also have experience with: **PHP, C++, Java and .NET**.

## Hardware I use

My main development machine is the awesome Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Extreme gen 2. Check out my [Uses page](/uses) for a more detailed look.
